It seems that many tables in your ehcp installation missing. This shows that, something went wrong in your ehcp installation. (not usually happens) <br>
we recommend installing ehcp again, or consult ehcp support at http://support.ehcp.net <br>
Even after reinstall if this is same, then, most probably there is a problem in the installer or the installer is not compatible with your system. <br>
Ehcp 0.38.3 and later is known to work for Ubuntu 16.04 and later. <br>
